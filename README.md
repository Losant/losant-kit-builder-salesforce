# Losant IoT Salesforce Builder Kit

In a factory, there are tons of hardware that work together to make a product. Unfortunately, things break and unexpected problems occur. Ideally, there would be a system in place that will automatically detect a failure and open up a maintenance/support ticket to resolve a problem. Salesforce Service Cloud is a smart, fast support platform with a powerful API. Losant can collect hardware data and trigger actions based on definable rules. In this workshop, we are going to use Salesforce Service Cloud and Losant together to solve this problem.

The Losant Salesforce Builder Kit is an easy way to get up and running with the Losant IoT developer platform and Salesforce Service Cloud. This kit provides all the hardware and software needed to build a few simple projects that cover a wide variety of the features within the Losant platform.

This repository contains the source code for the various workshops described in the [kit instructions](https://docs.losant.com/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-salesforce/).
